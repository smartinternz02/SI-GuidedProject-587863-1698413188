Introduction
Welcome to the security policy for our open-source project, which focuses on developing an AI system that verifies user identities based on online behavior patterns. Security is a top priority for our project, and we value the contributions of the security community in helping us maintain a secure environment.

Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security issue or vulnerability related to our project, please follow responsible disclosure practices by contacting us privately. You can report security issues to our dedicated email address: security@project-name.com.

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

A detailed description of the vulnerability.
Steps to reproduce the issue.
Any potential impact or attack scenario.
We encourage you to encrypt your communication with our PGP key:

We will acknowledge your report promptly, investigate the issue, and work to provide a fix or mitigation as needed. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will give credit to security researchers for their responsible disclosures.

Security Updates
We are committed to promptly addressing and fixing security issues. Once a security issue is reported and verified, we will work on a fix. We will then release a new version of the project that includes the necessary security updates.
